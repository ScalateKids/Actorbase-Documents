\section{Actorbase usage}

\subsection{ActorbaseDriver: Using Actorbase from inside a Scala source}

Actorbase is essentially an actor system built upon a server component that
exposes some API forming a RESTful web services. To facilitate the use from
inside a Scala source, it has been developed a driver in order to allow the
usage of all features that Actorbase provides.\\

\subsubsection{Quick Start: a generic example}

The most common operations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication;
\item Profile management operations;
\item Collections operations;
\item Administrative operations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Common.png}
    \caption{Driver usage: Generic example}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

These are some of the most common operations that the driver allows to do,
there's not too much boilerplate\footnote{A section of code that have to be
  included in many places with little to no alteration.} code, and it's possible
to make operations directly on objects representing \textbf{Actorbase}
collections\footnote{A data-structure constituted by a list of key-value items\label{coll}}
in a purely OOP (Object Oriented Programming) fashion.\\ As explained in
the snippet\footnote{A programming term for a small region of reusable code.}
image, these objects also retain some of the common functional constructs (e.g.
foreach), so it's possible to apply custom functions to every item of the
collection.

\subsection{More in depth: common operations}

\paragraph{Authentication}

Althrough in the future perhaps there could be the possibility to make some
operations as an anonymous user, at the current state the only possible action
that a non-logged-in user can do with ActorbaseDriver is the authentication.
This method send a login request to the server-side of the system and, according
to the response, it will return an \verb=ActorbaseService= or an
\verb=ActorbaseAdminServices=. These two objects give the methods to actually
make all operations on the database, the main difference is that
\verb=ActorbaseAdminServices= allows to do some high-level administrative
operations on users and collections of the system.

\paragraph{Profile management}

\textit{ActorbaseDriver} provides a method to modify the current password,
associated to an user profile.
e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-UserManagement.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: insertion methods}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}

\paragraph{Collections operations}

As previously explained, operations on the collections can be done in a purely
OOP way, this mean that all methods that return an \verb=ActorbaseCollection=,
gives the possibility to call all collection-management methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb=insert= methods:\\ These methods come in two variants, first one accepting
  a vararg\footnote{A sequence of arguments} of key-value tuple, the second
  accepting an
  \verb=ActorbaseObject=\footnote{An object representing a key-value pair inside Actorbase} instance;
  e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Insert.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: insertion methods}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\item \verb=remove= methods:\\ There're two variants of this method too, the usage is
  analogous to insert, e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Insert2.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: remove methods}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\item \verb=find= method:\\ This method accept one or more \verb=String= representing
  keys to be retrieved from the collection\textsuperscript{\ref{coll}}, again the usage is similar to insert and
  remove methods, e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Find.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: find method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\item \verb=findOne= method:\\ This method accept one \verb=ActorbaseObject= representing
  a key-value pair to be retrieved from the collection, again the usage is similar to insert and
  remove methods, e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-FindOne.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: findOne method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\item \verb=drop= methods:\\ Again this method have multiple variants, there's the
  \verb=dropCollections= that can be used to wipe out all the database, e.g.:
    % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-DropCollections.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: dropCollections method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
  the \verb=drop= inside an \verb=ActorbaseCollection= object:
    % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Drop.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
  and finally \verb=drop= inside an \verb=ActorbaseCollectionMap=, it takes a
  vararg of \verb=String= representing a sequence of collections to be removed
  e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Drop2.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
  \item printing collections:\\All object returned by \verb=ActorbaseDriver=
have an override\footnote{Specific implementation of a method in a subclass that
is already provided by one of its superclasses} to the method \verb=toString=
that return a pretty formatted JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) \verb=String=, e.g.:
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Printing.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\item \verb=count= elements inside a collection\textsuperscript{\ref{coll}} e.g.
    % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Counting.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Contributor management}

Each user in \textbf{Actorbase} have the possibility to add and remove contributors
to his collections\textsuperscript{\ref{coll}}, a user can be added with two level of
permission:
\begin{itemize}
\item read, means that a user can only make read operations on the collection\textsuperscript{\ref{coll}} without modifying it;
\item read-write, means that a user can make read and write operations on the collection\textsuperscript{\ref{coll}}.
\end{itemize}
e.g.:
% \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Contributor.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}

\paragraph{Administrative operations}

Actorbase expect two kind of users, common an administrator. The last one have
some privileges over the others, such as a wider range of collections (all
database) with read-write permissions, and capabilities of adding and removing
users to and from the system, and finally resetting the password of given users.
  % \begin{figure}[H]
  %   \begin{center}
  %     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{RQ/DevManual/Driver-Administrative.png}
  %     \caption{Driver usage: drop method}
  %   \end{center}
  % \end{figure}

\paragraph{Error management}

There is one error that is shared by every method and that is in case of a
connection error, which can be caused by not receiving a response from the
server in a predetermined time, the driver will launch a timeout connection
exception. There are some errors that are specific to some methods, these will
be explained in the section dedicated to the methods that cause them.
